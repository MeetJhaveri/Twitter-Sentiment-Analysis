## Twitter Sentiment Analysis
This project implements a sentiment analysis model for Twitter data, leveraging machine learning techniques to classify tweets into positive, negative, or neutral sentiments. The goal is to understand public sentiment on various topics by analyzing Twitter feeds.

Sentiment analysis on Twitter data helps in gauging public opinion, understanding trends, and making data-driven decisions. This project utilizes natural language processing (NLP) and machine learning algorithms to classify the sentiment of tweets.

## Features
- **Data Collection:** Gathers tweets using the Twitter API.

- **Data Preprocessing:** Cleans and prepares the text data for analysis, including tokenization and removal of stop words.
  
- **Feature Extraction:** Utilizes techniques like TF-IDF to convert text data into numerical features.
  
- **Model Training:** Trains classification models such as Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and Support Vector Machines (SVM) for sentiment analysis.
  
- **Evaluation:** Assesses model performance using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.

- **Visualization:** Provides visualizations of sentiment distribution and model performance.

## Results

- **Model Accuracy:** Achieved high accuracy in classifying tweet sentiments.
- **Visualization:** Insights into sentiment trends and model performance provided through visual tools.
